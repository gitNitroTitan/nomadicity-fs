## The Who, How, and Why

* **Target Audience**

This is for any user that wishes to explore and save hikes with content to their board for later use.

* **Purpose**

This project is for users who wish to add hikes to their board for saving content.

* **Getting Started**

You can start testing the product by logging in with your respective Google account or using the guest login button if you only wish to view the project without exploring all functions. If authenticated, use the home page buttons to view all the pins created in a random fashion. The best way to begin is to:

* Create a board on the board form page

* Create hikes under the board to have a collection of hikes based on your thought process or inspiration you wish to display.

* Use the sign out button to exit the app.
